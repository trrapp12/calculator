### QUICK START GUIDE


1. Create a Folder to hold the program
>  - in the terminal type `mkdir Calculator` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
>  - navigate into the folder by typing `cd Calculator`
>  - clone the program into the Calculator folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
https://github.com/trrapp12-ironyard/calculator.git
 ```
  <br/>
<br/>
2. Make sure you are still in the Calculator folder.  You can type `cd ..`  to move to navigate out to the parent directory or `cd` to navigate further down into the file.
<br/>
<br/>
3. You should be able to see a page named 'index.html'.  If not use `cd ..` to navigate back into the Calculator folder.
<br/>
<br/>  
4. Type `start index.html` to run the program from the terminal (in Windows), or `open index.html` on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
5. The program runs from prompts displayed by the browser as dialog boxes on the page.  Due to the nature of the `window.prompt()` function, to page will not execute any more of the JavaScript until the prompt is answered.  Therefore: 
<br/>
<br/>

> - if you fail to click "continue", the page won't advance
> - if you put a non-number (NaN) value in the prompt, it will return an error message. 
> - if you do not put any number in it will submit a "Null" value, and you will get an error message. 


<br/>
6. Enjoy!

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...

* It was a pretty straight forward bootcamp assignment, but as always it's always easy when you know the answer.  At the time the new material was new and I just had to put in time and practice learning.
