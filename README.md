This is version 1.0 of a JavaScript project designed to practive the following: 

- use of an IFFE function.
- use of multiple functions to create a script.
- use of hoisting in JavaScript.
- use of parameters in functions.
- use of `prompt()` to get user input. 
- use of `===` as a strict equality operator. 
- ECMAScript 6: use of `let` as a block scope variable.
- use of index.html
- use of `<script>` tags

### Instructions on how to launch:
---

1. Create a Folder to hold the program
  - in the terminal type `mkdir Calculator` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
  - navigate into the folder by typing `cd Calculator`
  - clone the program into the Hangman folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 https://github.com/trrapp12/object_oriented_hangman.git
 ```
  
5. Make sure you are still in the Hangman folder
6. You should be able to see a program named 'hangman.py'.  If not, navigate back into the Hangman folder.  
7. Type `python object_oriented_hangman.py` to run the program from the terminal
8. The program runs from prompts in the Command Line, so watch for prompts and respond accordingly. 
9. Enjoy!
